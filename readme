Object of this program is to build a simple GUI interface to allow for the easy visibility and editing of program level
fault messages and IDs as well as operator messages.

Current Progress...
Connects to PLC and lists programs, double clicking on a selected program will create an instance of the edit window for that
program.

Windows are layed out using PYQT5 designer and compiled into python classes.
main.py is the entry point

pyinstaller command to compile to a single file runtime
pyinstaller main.py --noconsole --onefile --name TDS_MessageTool --distpath ./Release

!!!!Ensure to run inside the Virtual Environment or pyinstaller will be unable to find the supporting libs!!!
Also app a path if libs are still not being found...shown below as example.

pyinstaller main.py --noconsole --onefile --name TDS_MessageTool_v#.# --distpath ./Release -p C:\Users\bob.saget\PycharmProjects\TDS_PyLogixTagInterpreter


Command to Compile the design files into python code...

pyuic5 PyQt5_DesignFile.ui -o MainWindow.py -x
'-x' option appends the snippet below if needed
(Run without "-x")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
    MainWindow = QtWidgets.QMainWindow()
    ui = Ui_MainWindow()
    ui.setupUi(MainWindow)
    MainWindow.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

run without that option since the compiled windows are wrapper classes and the [if __name__ == "__main__":] entry
is held in the main.py
