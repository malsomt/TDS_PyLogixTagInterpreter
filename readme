Run the command below to compile the design file into executable python code that will generate a window on runtime.

pyuic5 PyQt5_DesignFile.ui -o MainWindow.py -x

Results should be the same code that is generated in the designer with the addition of an "if main" executable.
Example of "if main" generated

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
    MainWindow = QtWidgets.QMainWindow()
    ui = Ui_MainWindow()
    ui.setupUi(MainWindow)
    MainWindow.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
